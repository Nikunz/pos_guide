                    <h3>Step 2: Press the Terminal Icon to get into user selection</h3>
                    <p>This gives you the option to get into selecting the user.</p>

                        <img src="terminal_option.jpeg" alt="Terminal Icon" class="image-style">
                    </p>    
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Step 3: Selecting User</h3>
                    <p>Select your user name from the following options which will prompt you to put your password</p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;">
                        <img src="user_list.jpeg" alt="User Selection" class="image-style">
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Step 4: User password</h3>
                    <p>Log in as the user with the password provided to you by the management.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;">
                        <img src="user_pin.jpeg" alt="User Pin" class="image-style">
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Step 5: Service Amount</h3>
                    <p>Enter the amount respective to ther service, if you entered the wrong amount you can clear the screen using "CLR" option on the screen and re-enter your amount</p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;">
                        <img src="payment_entry.jpeg" alt="Service Amount" class="image-style">
                    </p>    
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Step 6: Invoice Number</h3>
                    <p>After entering the amount of the said service, navigate to the top right corner of the screen where there are 3 vertical dots on the right side of seach option. Press the three dots to find an invoice option, upon clicking the invoice option a floating window will pop up prompting you to enter the invoice number.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;">
                        <img src="inv_entry_scrn2.jpeg" alt="Invoice Option" class="image-style">
                    </p>
                    <p> Note: The invoice number should be manually added for each and every purchase. For Example : If there was a transaction where the cutomer initially wanted to pay by debit and then decided to pay by cash and the Invoice number was not cleared it will show the same invoice number for the next transaction as well. In case it does happen contacting Amber will help resolve the situation.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Step 7: Payment Options</h3>
                    <p>On the bottom left corner of the POS you will see the options for "CASH" and "DEBIT/CREDIT". We do not use cash option for cash payments and should be done as we used to do before with older pos systems. The "DEBIT/CREDIT" option is to be used for payments by "VISA" "MASTERCARD" and "AMERICAN EXPRESS"</p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;">
                        <img src="cash_debit_credit_scrn.jpeg" alt="Payment Options" class="image-style">
                    </p>
                    <p> Please use the below images for reference for DEBIT/CREDIT payments : Based on which option you select a floating window appears on the screen indicating the form of payment and a prompt to INSERT/SWIPE the card. The option manual entry should not be used by any employee as its aaginst our company policy.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;">

                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Step 8: Account Selection</h3>
                    <p>After customer inserts His/Her card into the POS system the employee side will show the prompt "Waiting for Account Selection" while the customer decides from what account they would be paying the charges.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;">
                        <img src="account_selection_screen_employee.jpeg" alt="Invoice Option" class="image-style">
                    </p>
                    <p> If the payment cannot be completed after initiating the payment process , the system will pull up a timeout message "CARD entry timeout" message. we can retry the payment or cancel the transction at this step.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;">
                        <img src="card_timeout.jpeg" alt="Card Entry Timeout" class="image-style">
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Step 9: Payment Confirmation</h3>
                    <p>Once the payment is completed we get a message on the employee side of the screen "REMOVE CARD" and  the system will prompt a floating window which has options for SUMMARY, HISTORY, NOTES and RECEIPT. When we press the receipt option an other floating window prompts up with options "MERCHANT" and "CUSTOMER". To get the merchant and customer copy we need to select the appropriate option.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;">
                        <img src="after_payment_employee.jpeg" alt="Receipt Option" class="image-style">
                        <img src="payment_confirmation_page.jpeg" alt="Payment Confirmation" class="image-style">
                        <img src="receipt_print.jpeg" alt="Payment Confirmation" class="image-style">
                    </p>
                    <p> Note: Pressing the Done button before printing the merch/customer receipts will end the transaction and you won't be able to print receipts but for the latest transaction if you could not print the receipt there is an option to reprint the last transaction. If you want to print receipts for payements other than the last transaction you should contact Amber Immediately and notify her of this situation.</p>
